My enhanced credit evaluation function takes several input parameters and then applies a series of adjustments to produce a credit score and a recommendation. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

Starting Base Score:

We begin with a base score of 500. This is our starting point before considering any other factors.
Amount Requested:

We examine how much money is being requested:
If the requested amount is less than ₹100,000, we add 100 points (reflecting lower risk).
If it’s between ₹100,000 and ₹500,000, we add 50 points.
For larger amounts, we subtract 50 points (indicating higher risk).
Business Revenue:

The system considers the annual revenue of the business:
If revenue is ₹10,00,000 or more, we add 100 points.
If revenue is between ₹5,00,000 and ₹10,00,000, we add 50 points.
Lower revenues result in subtracting 20 points.
Business Age:

The number of years the business has been operating is taken into account:
Businesses 5 years or older receive an additional 50 points.
Those operating between 2 and 5 years get an extra 20 points.
Newer businesses (less than 2 years) lose 20 points.
Collateral Value:

This factor compares the collateral provided against the amount requested:
If the collateral is at least 1.5 times the amount requested, add 50 points.
If the collateral is roughly equal to the amount requested, add 20 points.
Otherwise, subtract 20 points.
Purpose of Loan:

The intended use of the funds is assessed by looking at keywords in the purpose:
If the purpose includes words like “expansion” or “growth”, we add 50 points.
If it includes words like “startup” or “new”, we subtract 50 points, since startups often carry higher risk.
Entrepreneur Name Length (as a Proxy for Experience):

Although a placeholder metric, we use the length of the entrepreneur's name as a dummy indicator:
If the name is longer than 10 characters, we add 20 points.
Otherwise, we subtract 10 points.
Clamping the Score:

After all adjustments, the score is clamped to ensure it stays within a realistic range—minimum 300 and maximum 850 (similar to standard credit score ranges).
Recommendation:

Finally, the algorithm provides a recommendation:
If the final score is above 700, it recommends that the applicant is “Eligible for standard funding.”
If the score is 700 or below, it suggests to “Consider alternative financing options.”
In Summary:
Input Factors: entrepreneurName, amountRequested, purpose, businessRevenue, businessAge, and collateralValue.
Adjustments: Each factor either increases or decreases the base score based on the assumed risk or benefit.
Final Score & Recommendation: The result is a credit score (clamped between 300 and 850) along with a recommendation about funding eligibility.
This is a simulation meant to illustrate how a more data-driven, nuanced approach could work. In a real system, you might replace or supplement these rules with a trained machine learning model that considers a broader range of financial and behavioral data.
